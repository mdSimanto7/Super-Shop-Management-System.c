# Super-Shop-Management-System.c
This project is a simple Super Shop Management System created in the C programming language. Its purpose is to simulate a basic point-of-sale system for a small shop. The program allows a user to view a list of available products with their prices, select items to purchase by their ID, specify a quantity, and calculate a final bill.
